 @section issues Program Issues
 There were a few minor technical problems, the biggest one being when attempting to run an audio file Jonathan C's VM would crash. Other than that there weren't any other issues that couldn't be resolved, and the program functions as it should.
 
 @section challenges Challenges
 There were a few challenges, the largest challenge in programming was attempting to figure out how to adapt the code work based on the different audio files, changing between 8-bit, 16-bit mono and stereo. Another challenge was trying to adjust the processing to work for stereo.
