There were a few minor technical problems, the biggest one being when attempting to run an audio file Jonathan C\textquotesingle{}s VM would crash. Other than that there weren\textquotesingle{}t any other issues that couldn\textquotesingle{}t be resolved, and the program functions as it should.\hypertarget{index_challenges}{}\section{Challenges}\label{index_challenges}
There were a few challenges, the largest challenge in programming was attempting to figure out how to adapt the code work based on the different audio files, changing between 8-\/bit, 16-\/bit mono and stereo. Another challenge was trying to adjust the processing to work for stereo.\hypertarget{index_instructions}{}\section{Instructions to Build}\label{index_instructions}
Nothing is required beyong \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}. The final executable is called \char`\"{}\+Wav\+Processor\char`\"{}.
